      <p>
        Small-scale wind turbines are considered recently as an attractive source of renewable energy, especially at remote area with respect to city centre. The design and characterization of a small vertical wind turbine are introduced through this work. A CFD analysis has been used as a first step in design to simulate the flow around the vertical blades of the small wind turbine. Different parameters have been taken into account in this work such as blades number, shape, and existence of stator blades deflector. Three different versions depend on blade profile have been examined. The turbulence model with sliding mesh in CFD have been performed. In this paper, a performance of small-scale of vertical wind turbine represented by CFD results of power coefficient, and optimal freestream velocity of this model are presented. The results showed that using 8 blades of VAWT instead of 4 blades with the same profile of blade has enhanced VAWT performance up to 64%. Also, increasing the concave profile of the blade can rise the torque produced by approximately 8%, however more increase in concave shape cause drop down by 5.6%. Moreover, including stator deflector to the VAWT design has ability to increase the torque produced by 70%. The output of these results will help to choose the optimum configuration of the small vertical wind turbine to implement this design experimentally as a next step.
